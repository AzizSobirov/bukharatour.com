                regime applies to citizens of the indicated countries, owners of
                all categories of passports (diplomatic, official and general)
                planning to visit the Republic of Uzbekistan for up to 30 days,
                regardless of the purpose of their trip. A visa-free regime does
                not apply to stateless persons permanently residing in the
                territories of these countries. It is important to know! A
                visa-free regime is valid for 30 days from the date of entry
                into Uzbekistan. Before the end of the 30-day visa-free stay, a
                foreign citizen must leave the Republic of Uzbekistan. Exceeding
                the 30-day visa-free stay is a violation of the rules of stay of
                foreign citizens in the Republic of Uzbekistan. Accordingly, if
                it is necessary to stay in Uzbekistan for more than 30 days, a
                foreign citizen must obtain an entry visa to the Republic of
                Uzbekistan in accordance with the purpose of his trip before
                entering Uzbekistan. 1.2. A visa is not needed for foreign
                citizens under the age of 16, accompanied by legal
                representatives and the presence of a biometric travel document,
                for the duration of the visa of the accompanying person, but no
                more than ninety days from the date of entry into the country.
                1.3. To simplify obtaining a visa to Uzbekistan, the government
                launched a system of issuing electronic entry visas
                «E-VISA.GOV.UZ» It is enough for an applicant from 57 countries
                (from January 1, 2020) to fill in the questionnaire, receive
                confirmation of the application by e-mail, pay the consular fee
                and wait 3 business days to receive the application results. The
                finished electronic visa to Uzbekistan will be sent to the
                applicant's mail in PDF format. An electronic visa allows entry
                into Uzbekistan for up to 30 days, and is valid for 90 days from
                the date of issue. The cost of a visa depends on the frequency
                of entry: single entry - $ 20, double entry - 35, multiple entry
                - 5
